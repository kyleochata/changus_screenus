Changus Screenus is a Go program that changes your screensaver to a random picture from a folder found in this project name `images`. It is currently only supported by Windows. Linux and MacOS are among future updates.

## Features

- Selects a random image from a specified folder.
- Sets the screensaver to the selected image.
- Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kyleochata/changus_screenus.git
   cd changus_screenus/cmd/change_screensaver
   ```

2. Build the project:

```sh
go build
```

- This will create a `change_screensaver.exe` file in the `change_screensaver` directory.

3. Add desired images to the `images` directory found at the root level of the repository.

- Ensure that they are in a format that is accepted by Windows (I stick with jpegs)

4. Changus_Screenus!

```
./change_screensaver -folder ../../images/
```
